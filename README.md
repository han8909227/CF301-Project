## About us 
* We are a group of students studying advance JS development here at Codefellows, as the final project for one of our class we made this site Ticket Jedi, our goal and hope is to simplify the event searching process. For an example you would like to attend a country music concert during your week-long stay in Miami, in the Ticket Master website this search will take several step to complete (e.g search country => sort by city => sort by date) whereas in our site this take only <b>one<b> step. You may enter the city, keyword(e.g concert), genre(music/country), optional min/max dates(lower/uppper bound for your date) and with a click of a button you will find the result that fits your criteria. Click on the result can lead you directly to the ticket purchasing page, and you can also twitt about the event!
